I use cyberchef to check file type because the challenge said it is encrypted.

Checked and realized its a .wav audio file (RIFFH Wave)

so I converted it to .wav and when I played, it sounded like morse code so I dragged it to https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html
